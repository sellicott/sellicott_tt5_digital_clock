# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
     Simple digital clock, displays hours, minutes, and seconds in either a 12h or a 24h format
     (selectable by user input). Since there are not enough output pins to directly drive a 6x
     7-segment displays, the data is shifted out serially using an internal 8-bit shift register.
     The shift register drives 6-external 74xx596 shift registers to the displays. Clock and control
     signals (`clk_out`, `latch_out`) are also used to shift and latch the data into the external 
     shift registers respectively. The time can be set using the `set_hours` and `set_minutes` inputs.
     If `set_fast` is high, then the the hours or minutes will be incremented at a rate of 5Hz, 
     otherwise it will be set at a rate of 1Hz. Note that when setting either the minutes, rolling-over
     will not affect the hours setting.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
     Connect serial output to a 6x 8-bit shift registers to display the output on 6x 7-segment displays

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - refclk - reference clock (32768 Hz) 
    - use_refclk - select whether to divide the system clock or use an external reference (0: system clock, 1: refclk)
    - fast_set - select whether to set the time using a fast (5Hz) or a slow (2Hz) clock (0: slow, 1: fast) 
    - hours_set - set the hours (when both hours_set and minutes_set are simultaneously pressed, seconds are cleared)
    - minutes_set - set the minutes 
    - none

# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
